This is the 2nd generation quicwind code. It is currently hosted at
https://github.com/openwfm/wrf-fire-matlab/tree/quicwind/quicwind/saddlepoint
To see what it can do, try the current driver saddle_test_n_3d.m
The code in this directory is meant to be self-contained.
We are copying files from the parent directory as needed.
